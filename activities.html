Since the inception of NSS by the Indian Government, a unit of National Service Scheme was started in our institution. NSS is a voluntary association of young people in colleges, universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community linkage, aimed at developing student’s personality through community service. We work with a main motto of “NOT ME, BUT YOU”. NSS at NIT, Durgapur is currently being supervised/coordinated by Dr.Shri Krishan Rai. We observe many important events celebrated by Government of India like Independence Day, Republic day, Swachchta Pakhwada, Vigilance awareness week, National Education day, Hindi Pakhwada, Matribhasha diwas etc., Our volunteers participate in the Parade that takes place in our college during Independence Day, Republic Day and Sports day every year. In order to create awareness, our volunteers even conduct some rallies, quizzes, essay writing competitions etc., on National Education Day, Vigilance awareness week etc. Also as a part of Matribhasha diwas we organise a major event containing cultural performances by students from various parts of our country and also a food fest where students from different regions cook and sell some famous dishes of their regions. Apart from the above events we do make some camps at nearby villages. This includes Annual Medical Camp (in which we organise basic medical facilities for two or three days in a nearby village), Plastic Free Village and Water Conservation Campaign (in which we explained people in a nearby village about ill effects of Plastic on earth, importance of water conservation and distributed Jute bags), Plantation campaign within the campus.</p>
